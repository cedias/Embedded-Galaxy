# Embedded-Galaxy: An Interactive Map of Embeddings

This project visualizes a large number (eg., 20,000) of embeddings in two dimensions
It yields an interactive, statically served site where users can explore the space by zooming & panning.

This is a fork from [wordgalaxy](https://github.com/anthonygarvan/wordgalaxy).
